In today's class, we made an installation that draws without a connection with hand. I made two structure that is connected with the mouse. One of the design is using wires connect with the notebook and attach the pen to the wire-like two fishing pole. By use thread, attach the wire to the mouse. I was able to get the pathway of how I used the mouse. The other one is the same kind of process, but this time the wire is directly connected with the mouse. 
Nonhuman drawing's beauty is in its unpredictable and imperfect in the human sense. It's made by man to work not like man. In our history, we chase for perfect, but nothing is perfect and most of the time is the unperfect made things beautiful.
