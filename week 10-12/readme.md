I have learned so much from the course. Not just the ability to code, I also entered a new area of generating design. I have looked up so many artworks. I have even heard before. I can understand the code, even just the most fundamental part. It feels like all those movies about AI suddenly not stories for me. I could understand how powerful it is.  
Moreover, think about what could I do with code future is excited. With my project, I could already think if I combined it with Kinect. It could be shown in the way that I pitched. Also, with all those classmates who showed me all the different area, this could go. I am still not really comfortable about code. Code isn't my area, but I like how to code able to visualize in a different way we usually worked a designer. Sometimes I feel that when we are working on generating design is the opposite way of graphic design. We use to working on a design from visual to content, but with generating design, we made the content to the visualized system.
