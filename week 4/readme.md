We learned how to load the image in processing and also add motions to text. Also discussed what kind of project we want to pitch.  My idea is to make a system that likes the online version of fortune cookies. Something simple but could make people happy, but I don't have a picture in mind yet. I don't know how this idea could combine with code and visualize it. 
I researched on visual installation and found some interesting work with projection. Most of those work in hold inside the art gallery with a great atmosphere. The light of the projection work on a dark room brings people into another world. I want to do something similar but still could work with the fortune cookies idea.
I remember there is a kind projection work often placed in a mall or children's play area which when you stamp on there will be some interaction. For example, if the projection is a bubble and your stamp on it, the bubble will be broken and show up with some effect. So I could have a wall when people are walking by and touch it there be some effect.
