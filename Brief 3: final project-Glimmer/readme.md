# Glimmer
The project glimmer is making from processing-java. Used drawing as interact for the audience to get text content. This work aims to use language and the visual effect to make the audience feel better at that moment. This project isn’t complicated, but it is something I can do, and I hope even it is something small something like a glimmer even just a second, but it could make someone feels better and make some slight different for people’s day.  
From my pitch idea to my final work, I have always thought I don’t want to make something complicated and fancy. I want this to be simple. By simple, I mean it doesn’t have to be super helpful or had some real function. It should be meaningful, but won’t draw too much attention from people like those little sketch coffee shop drawn on their cup. It doesn’t make the coffee more taste, but when you see it, it will make you feel better.  For me, during this time in lockdown and doing all the staff all by myself, sometimes it is hard. All I can do is try my best to find every small difference in my everyday life, and even just a tiny thing could make me feel batter for a moment. That’s why this work could help some people. People who are alone in this situation have isolated from their social life. Even with friend and family, they don’t want to drag them into that lousy mood, So I hope this work could help a bit, as the smiling face on the coffee cup.
