Kunhao Lin is an artist that I liked very much. He often uses digital work to express a different side of the world. X’Diptera is a project that uses algorithmic to generate the possible texture of butterfly. To be honest, I didn’t get what is the point of this at first. It to me just beautiful visual artwork, But somehow I keep curious about what could be next butterfly look like? That’s where I realise that’s the whole point. As a human, we interested pretty much about everything. We care about from the smallest cell to galaxies that are light-years away. Some of us spend a lifetime to prove an equation. Some of us putting continuous training to be able to control every muscle in their body. What is the point of that? For others who are not in their area wouldn’t even think about the matter. 
This project has made me surprised by how someone could start with a simple idea to such fantastic work. The literary quotation the artist has talked in his statement has brought back the question What can’t algorithms do? It takes Nanke a dream to have another life, and with coding, it only takes enough data to make people endless dream. Moreover, I also interested in the way he combines those culture and poetic quotation into his work.

Another work from Kunhao Lin he uses a large amount of information and reading, and consciously established a huge text gene library, and generated the mother words and sentences through the random matching of computers. Based on the processing of these paired words and sentences, a more complete and artistic combination is formed. Moreover, he combines the generated text with also generated video, with a voice to read the generated poetry and music. I could already imagine how shocked the audience would feel if this video is a projection in a vast and spacious room.
Poetry is one of the most beautiful ways of how is language has been used, and it could also be generated. It took poet years of learning and experience to write poetry. Still, the computer can theoretically produce 35 trillion unique texts, and the number is increasing. It makes me think about the relationship between algorithm and human. I have read a paragraph online it said: “human being with a brain that still is the same thing from a thousand years ago. But build many systems with thousands of most intelligent person in the world to do the jobs that we cannot do. So what could the future be?”

Bosphorus is made by Refik Anadol. It is a  work that visualises nature to digital. The audience could stand inside a room to watch and feel the change of Marmara sea. Through the artwork, the audience can experience the transformation of the sea in a place. Within the 3d visual effect, the audience will directly experience the power of nature in a room. The rhythm of the special effect is a combination of nature and digital. It makes people join with the universality of the algorithm. I wonder if, in the future world, we could feel all the experience that has disappeared in real life with the digital world. Or maybe like the movie, we will actually live in the digital and become a part of the algorithm.

Arno Beck has nothing to do with computer-generated art. He is an old-fashioned artist stuck in new times. He is insisting on turning this kind of imagery into analogue form by using acrylics, woodblock prints and even typewriters as mediums instead of a cursor.
 His prints and conceptual paintings evolve around digital aesthetics and focus on analogue production of digital images. It is an interplay between the new digital screen world and traditional techniques. By using those manual, analogue techniques, He aims to make the digital images physically experienceable.
As a painter engaging with digital culture, He is transferring those experiences into painting. He aims to portray the essence of the digital. Low-resolution or high-pixelation are critical characteristics of digital representation because those are features you won’t find beyond computer-generated imagery.
Initially, digital art is intangible, and as a painter, He is expressing the urge to capturing digital aesthetics with painterly means. So, when you deal with digital images and transfer them into the physical space, you have to start thinking about surface structure and how the materialisation can be achieved. The transformation of those screen based impressions and the materialisation into physical, haptic existence is one of the critical aspects of his work. With my approach, he humanises technology to make the error is part of the beauty.
That series of woodblock prints is based on the thirty-two colours that the GameBoy Color console was able to display. He mixes my oil colours with this thirty-two-colour palette. He applies them to twelve thousand small hand-cut wood bricks, each representing a single pixel in the motif. Line by line, I combine these wood bricks to a giant mosaic, which he then printed on thin Japanese paper. He also works with the typewriter. He was continuously searching for different analogue ways of translating digital imagery from the screen to the pictorial space. The typewriter drawings are achieved by typing line by line using an old-fashioned manual typewriter. He utilises different letters and symbols, which create a variety of differing grey values.

This installation has created an immersive space where images, shapes, materials and sounds surround visitors, making them feel the entirety of the area around them and evoke the sensation of the other world.
Creatures existing on the walls of the membrane are the result of combining human emotional expression with the mathematical aspect.
To incarnate the creatures Tatiana Plakhova created an abundance of flat graphical prototypes. By studying them, a team of installation authors was trying to get the idea of how to transform these two-dimensional static images into movable living creatures. The task was to create new living forms – unique creatures dissimilar to any known living form. The creatures were supposed to represent several worlds: the world of living natural systems, the world of cosmic objects and the world of pure mathematical abstractions.
To implement the idea Vadim Smakhtin and Eduard Haiman created software using vvvv comprised of animated algorithms and visualising engine. With the help of the software, it became possible by using the prepared 2D curves to make 3D objects that may alter and mutate. Thus Tatyana Plakhova got the possibility to design and adjust the items herself and this, in turn, helped to directly join the independence of creativity and art and rigidity of digital code. Using the software, Tatiana Plakhova created an abundance of digital prototypes.
Along with the creation of visual objects were designed the images and shapes of spaces where the creatures may “exist”. After more than a year of experiments there appeared a possibility to arrange a large-scale installation in an art-gallery Mar’s. On the assumption of the specificity of the space, a concept of a soft cave (*antrum - (Latin) cave, grotto as well as the threshold) was built up. The idea, as well as the creation of digital creatures, were based on mathematical laws.
The stretching surface of the membrane was specially designed. So the physical properties of its materials were similar to those of minimal mathematical surfaces. At the same time, the tension of the membrane will help visitors who decided to touch the membrane to interact with the creatures projected on it. The membrane is a pavilion made from bi flex fabric stretched inside a room.
A parametric model of the membrane was created with the use of Rhino+Grasshopper program. This model allowed to calculate the parameters of the shapes taking into account tension of the fabric, placement of projectors, properties of projection areas and rolling out of material with allowance made for the width of the fabric.
Ultrasonic distance sensors that with the use of the Arduino module transmit data to vvvv patch were used to pick up the data received after a visitor touching the membrane. Each creature supposed to respond to feeling in its own unique manner.
The 4-channel generative sound was created and employed by Sergey Kasich with the help of Pure Data. Consequently, when a visitor touches the membrane, it responds to it not only in the form of visual effects but also by a variety of sounds.
Thus was created a small closed world where sight, hearing, sense of space and tactile sensations interact.

Suzuki has dyslexic, and he cannot read musical scores. However, He has a passion for playing and creator playing music, and I always dream to create new notation of music. In this installation, people can interact with robots and discover the original method to make music.
If we consider the field of music, the whole creation process takes place within a computer, everything is computer-based. Consequently, people tend to leave behind physicality, they miss touching the devices and the instruments.
This material aspect is essential in design. Physicality and touching are imperative, so a computer-based design is not only about the computer. This can be partially true for music, as we previously said, but for design materiality and “the feeling of touching” an object are necessary. Concerning music, a CD or a vinyl gives you access to your memory, and visual sensations (for instance in looking at the cover or touching the material support) and this experience is not provided by an mp3 track.
