What could the final work be? My idea is to use drawing as an interaction for the system. When the audience draws, they will get a paragraph that matches with their drawing. How to like the text with a draw? Also, how is the system going to recognize the drawing?
The solution I had in mind is compared with trying to let the system recognize the drawing. I could have a background filled with dots, so when people draw on top, the course will pick up the number of the dots the line has covered. Moreover, I also need to find a way to visualize the text.
I looked up many Openprocessing projects. I found many-particle system effects that look amazing. I feel by using the particle to make the text is looking really great.
