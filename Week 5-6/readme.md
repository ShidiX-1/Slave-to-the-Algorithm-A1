Under the lockdown, people are affected mentally and physically. What can I do about it? While waiting for the cure? I want to do something small something like a glimmer even just a second, but it could someone feels better.

When people walking by the wall, it will appear some random text through the text, sound and the visual effects to cheer up people. It is an interactive wall that could be everywhere in the city, and everyone will have access to this device.
When I first thought about this idea, it supports only on the phone, iPad or computer. Where we can easily have access to, but, I realized not everyone has or right at those technologies. So I want it to be on the street.The whole idea behind this is to stimulate people and make them feel better at that moment with the language, sound and the visual effect. Meanwhile, with no limitation of place, everyone who passes by will have admittance to this device.

# How can I make it 

-sensor

-led screen

-text 

-sound 

-generate graphic 


lastly, when I realize that when I started to develop this idea. I hope this could cheer up people, the people should be no limitation, but I did even thought about someone may not have access to technology elderly who are not good at using technology.
However, I hope Glimmer is an installation that everyone could have access to and through straightforward content, people will feel better even just when they see it.
