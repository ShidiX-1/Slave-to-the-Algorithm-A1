Wow for this week. I have ever learned code before, and I always thought it wasn't my thing. I don't want to even look at it. However, I never know it could be just that easy, and that looks like magic. 
Processing is like a graph that has an X axial and a Y axial when we give the point a location processing will put that in canvas for us, and when we add in a variable into X and Y, it will be able to change the location. The variable also comes in many forms, and by adding it to different areas, we can get a different effect. We practice drawing our face when we exhibit the outcome. I found if quite interesting that even we all in the same class and learned the same code, but we get many different types of the portrait.
