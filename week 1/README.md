Week 1 in class, we talked about what is the algorithm and why should we make those kinds of work? I think through the talk the word "possibility" popped up in my mind. As human we create, we study, and we think, but we always have some rules or process in order to make something. Meanwhile, one of the fascinating parts about generative design is that it doesn't "think."  or "work" as we do. It brings us more of those possibilities.
Moreover, with the algorithms, how many possibilities we could get. In the past, people draw and write about all the fancy we had in mind. Now with code, it develops all the fantasy to reality.
